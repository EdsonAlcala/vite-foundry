# Build On Base Boilerplate (Vite + Foundry)

Simple, minimalistic and opinionated [Vite] + [Foundry] boilerplate to start developing Onchain Apps on Base.

This boilerplate is designed to work with the following stack:

- [Foundry]
- [Vite] - Vite React TS
- [Anvil]
- [RainbowKit]

## Features

- Automatic React hooks generation ([see guide below](#automatic-react-hooks-generation))
- Wallet integration with [RainbowKit]
- Bring your own UI framework
- [Tailwind CSS] integration

## Requirements

- [NVM]
- [Yarn] # Once you run `nvm use` install it globally via `corepack enable`
- [Foundry]
- [Alchemy API Key]
- [Wallet connect id]

*Note: Since WalletConnect requires a projectId and it is free and easy to get, we recommend getting a projectId from WalletConnect Cloud.

## Architecture ðŸ“¦

The project consist of 2 packages:

- [App](./packages/app) - Vite
- [Foundry](./packages/foundry/) - Smart contract project

## Getting started

If you are setting up this boilerplate using the [Build On Base CLI] you can go to step 2.

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/edsonalcala/vite-foundry

$ nvm use

$ yarn 
```

2. Set values in the `.env` file. You will need:

```bash
MNEMONIC
BASESCAN_API_KEY
CHAIN_ID
VITE_APP_WALLET_CONNECT_ID
VITE_APP_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
```

Check the `.env.sample` file that includes some default values.

In order to get a BaseScan API Key, please refer to [this guide].

3. Start Anvil by running:

```bash
yarn chain
```

4. On a second terminal, deploy the smart contracts contract to the local `Anvil` instance by running:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

5. On a new terminal, start the Vite app by running:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Automatic React hooks generation

This boilerplate contains a `Wagmi` integration that automatically generates `React hooks`, so you don't need to copy ABIs anymore or addresses from your deployed contracts. You can see an example in `app/src/views/ConnectedView.tsx`, where we read the value of the `storedData` of the `SimpleStorage` contract via:

```Typescript
const { data: simpleStorageValue } = useSimpleStorageRead({
  functionName: 'storedData'
})
```

Notice the hook import:

```Typescript
import { useSimpleStorageRead } from '@app/generated'
```

The hooks generated are in the `app/src/generated.ts` file. You can customise this output path in the `wagmi.config.ts`.

```Typescript
export default defineConfig({
  out: 'src/generated.ts',
  plugins: [
    foundry({
      project: '../foundry',
      deployments: require('../foundry/deployments/deploymentAddresses.json')
    }),
    react()
  ],
})
```

The `wagmi.config.ts` also contains a reference to the `deploymentAddresses.json`. This file is required in order to generate the React hooks and is generated by the `Deploy.s.sol` file in the foundry project.

However, in order to generate this file we need to explicitly tell to our solidity script to do the exporting.

The `foundry/script/Deploy.s.sol` contains at the end of the `run` function the following:

```Javascript
_startExport();
_addExport("SimpleStorage", address(simpleStorage));
_stopExport();
```

With these lines of code we are explicitly exporting into the `deploymentAddresses.json` the name of the contract with its respective address per network.

```json
{
  "SimpleStorage": {
    "31337": "0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9"
  }
}
```

If you need to add more contracts, you will do it as:

```Javascript
_startExport();
_addExport("Contract1", address(contract1));
_addExport("Contract2", address(contract2));
_addExport("Contract3", address(contract3));
_stopExport();
```
